# React-Admin-dashboard_website
This Project Basically work on #VITE.js + #REACT.JS
#npm create vite@latest
Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:

:-A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

:-A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

#yarn create vite
#npx degit user/project my-project
#cd my-project
#npm install
#npm run dev

Yarn is an established open-source package manager used to manage dependencies in JavaScript projects. It assists with the process of installing, updating, configuring, and removing packages dependencies, eventually helping you reach your objectives faster with fewer distractions.

In this project We used REACT LIBARIES to make project faster and smoother like :- #"react-router-dom": "^6.8.1" ,#"react-icons": "^4.7.1",# "material-react-table": "^1.8.1",#"echarts-for-react": "^3.0.2",#"echarts": "^5.4.1",#"@asseinfo/react-kanban": "^2.2.0",# "@mui/icons-material": "^5.11.9",#"zustand": "^4.3.3",.

For STATE MANGEMENT we use REACT-HOOK.
